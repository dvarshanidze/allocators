# Custom Memory Allocators in C

**Custom Memory Allocators in C** This project provides implementations of various memory allocators in C, including arena and stack allocators.

## Features

- **Arena Allocator**: A memory allocator that provides a region of memory for dynamic allocation, which can be useful for managing memory in a specific context or scope.
- **Stack Allocator**: A simple, stack-based allocator that allows for fast memory allocation and deallocation in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
